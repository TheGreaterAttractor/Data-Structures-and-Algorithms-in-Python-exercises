#The birthday paradox says that the probability that two people in a room will have the same birthday is more than half, 
# provided n, the number of people in the room, is more than 23. This property is not really a paradox, but many people 
# Ô¨Ånd it surprising. Design a Python program that can test this paradox by a series of experiments on randomly generated 
# birthdays, which test this paradox for n = 5,10,15,20,...,100.
