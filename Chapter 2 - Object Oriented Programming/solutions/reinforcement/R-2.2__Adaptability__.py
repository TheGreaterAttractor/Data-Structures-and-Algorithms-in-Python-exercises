# A Visual effects and animation software

# Visual effects and animation softwares need to be highly adaptable due to
# the rapid evolution occuring in the sector. Live action movies are spending 
# less time in post production, GPU based rendering is on the rise and advanced 
# technologies like motion capture are being adopted widely. There is also the 
# rise in VR and AR and the demand for more realistic gaming experience. Any 
# VFX software has to be able to incorporate these new technologies or it would
# be left behind. If a VR development suite, a renderer, game engine or any
# such extension or plugin became popular, a VFX software company should be 
# able to rapidly make updates to its software to allow it support this new 
# plugin
