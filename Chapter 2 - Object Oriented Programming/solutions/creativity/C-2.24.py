#Suppose you are on the design teamfor a new e-book reader. What are the primary classes and methods that the Python software for your reader 
# will need? You should include an inheritance diagram for this code, but you do not need to write any actual code. Your software architecture 
# should at least include ways for customers to buy new books, view their list of purchased books, and read their purchased books.
